# Snake Game üêç

This project is a modern rendition of the classic Snake Game, implemented using Python and the `turtle` graphics module. 

Players can control the snake using arrow keys to eat food, grow in size, and score points. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

## Features
- **Real-time gameplay:** Smooth animations with adjustable speed.
- **Score Tracking:** Tracks the player's score and displays it in real-time.
- **Game Over Screen:** Displays a message when the game ends.
- **Dynamic Snake Growth:** Snake grows in size each time it eats food.
- **Randomized Food Placement:** Food appears in random positions within the game area.
- **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions with walls and the snake's tail.
